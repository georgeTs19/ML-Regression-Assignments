Project Title: Machine Learning from a Regression Perspective - Assignment 1
Overview
This repository contains the first assignment from the course Machine Learning from a Regression Perspective, part of the Master's program in Data Analytics and Business Economics at Lund University, Sweden. The assignment focuses on applying regression-based machine learning methods to analyze and interpret data within a business and economic context.

File Structure
DABN13_Assignment1.ipynb
A Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation, analysis, and results of the assignment tasks. The notebook explores regression methodologies using Python libraries.

dataset/

Guns.dta
A Stata dataset used in the assignment. It includes variables related to economic and social factors, potentially influencing outcomes modeled in the assignment.
Dataset Information
Dataset Name: Guns.dta
Format: Stata (.dta)
Description:
The dataset includes economic and demographic indicators relevant to the analysis conducted in the assignment. Variables are preprocessed to align with regression methods used in the notebook.
Source:
Provided as part of the course materials for analysis and learning purposes.
Objective
The primary goal of this assignment is to apply regression-based machine learning techniques to a real-world dataset. The focus is on understanding model performance, feature selection, and interpretability in a predictive context.

Instructions
Open the DABN13_Assignment1.ipynb file using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
Ensure the dataset (Guns.dta) is placed in the appropriate directory to enable seamless data loading.
Follow the step-by-step implementation in the notebook to explore the methodologies and replicate the results.
Requirements
Python Environment:
Install the following Python libraries before running the notebook:

pandas
numpy
statsmodels
matplotlib
seaborn
Stata File Support:
Ensure pandas or similar library can handle .dta files.
